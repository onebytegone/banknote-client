# TODO

This is the log for what needs to be completed on `banknote-client`. Mostly this is ramblings of Ethan.


## Now

  * FIX: Total not totaling on `MonthlyTable`
  * Assign table (Allows value to be assigned to an account)
    * UI
    * Functionality
  * Standard table configuration
  * Scrolling for `ListView` table
  * Controllers for each table section (Defines all operations for the model)
  * Add proper headers to code files

## Low Priority

  * Add more color
  * Remove "add" text, only use icon
  * Clean up extra log messages
  * File import/export
    * Format for data needs to be defined
    * Experiment further with JS file IO
    * Startup screen
  * Better division for html templates (Different files for each section)

## Wishlist

  * Dropbox integration
  * Encryption
  * Graphs (http://www.chartjs.org/)
